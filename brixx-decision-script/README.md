# Was ist Brixx-Decision-Script

## “Decisions make up more than 90% of programming!”

Brixx-Decision-Script is a free JavaScript library for rule-based decision systems. With our **Brixx-Decision-Script**, the programming can be reduced to a minimum and for extensions and adjustments via rules, for example with an external decision table, it can be replaced by a technical configuration (low-code development).
Fast integration into any HTML document is possible, especially with our [Brixx-Script (smarte web components)](https://brixx.it/brixx-script.html) as Brixx HTML elements or as Brixx script components in JavaScript applications and frameworks and also support JavaScript environments such as [Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Opensource cross platform JavaScript runtime environment") (cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment).
