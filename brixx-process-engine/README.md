## The easiest way to build digital processes and workflows

With **Brixx Process Engine** we bridge the gap to enterprise process orchestration systems, such as Camunda or X4 BPMS, as a lightweight workflow management system for the automation and digitization of business and industrial processes. For processes in web applications up to IoT control. With minimal development, integration and cost effort, the Brixx Process Engine can serve as the basis for applications or be integrated into existing applications as an extension for sub-processes.

- Lightweight process enging
- Simple system integration
- No special training needed
- No special server hardware
- or installation needed
- No database required
- Cross platform development
- Cross ui development
- Low Code development
- Full HTML and JavaScript support
- IoT (Internet of Things) control and  
  (Single-Board-Computer) support
- BPMN 2.0 Standard
- Suitable for BPMN training
- Cloud (FaaS) and Blockchain ready
- ChatGPT ready

## Why a process engine especially for web technologies?

We have decided to publish a web-based process engine for creating digital processes and workflows. As a result, Brixx Process Engineering can be used in all infrastructure systems for low-code development without a special platform. In addition, **Brixx-Process-Script** allows direct integration into an HTML, which makes it something special. This also gives non-programmers the opportunity to design digital processes and workflows. Ask about integration into your applications, whether Python, Java, as a RESTful API or as a Docker solution.

## Model processes and workflows

With our workflow management system, all types of processes and workflows can be mapped with the [Brixx BPMN editor](../brixx-bpmn-editor/README.md) for process modeling with BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) and made available in the Brixx Process Engine with one click. 

## Model processes and workflows

With [Brixx-Process-Script](../brixx-process-script/README.md), processes and workflows can be created requirement-oriented with **Process Driven Development** and a complete integration into web applications with HTML and JavaScript is possible. For example, applications with the Four Eyes 
Principle (Two-man rule), multi-level forms, or web applications for processing task stacks in a team can be created quickly and easily.
